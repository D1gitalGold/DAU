# DAU 🟡 GLDx Drip Protocol ☠️

**Hold. Accrue. Print.**

An experimental Solana rewards protocol that drips **$GLDx (Solana xStocks)** directly to holders over time.

No staking.  
No lockups.  
No mercy.

Just raw time-weighted emissions.

## 🧠 What This Is

GLDx Drip is a passive yield experiment that streams **$GLDx** to wallets holding a target SPL token.

- No deposits
- No unstaking
- No UI required
- Works with bots, scripts, or raw RPC calls

If your wallet has balance → **you’re accruing**.
